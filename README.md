# CSharp

******************************************************************************************************************************************
This repo consists of close to all of the programs I created using Visual Studio along with C#. 
I believe I took this class sometime around 2018 so this code is not an accurate representation of my coding skills.
Who knows, I havent touched C# since this class so I may not be as good at it as I was then.
